    "links future field development to a yet-to-be-built pipeline \n",
    "that would ship North Slope natural gas to the lower 48 U.S. \n",
    "states. The natural gas pipeline, a massive project estimated \n",
    "to cost over $20 billion, is expected to take years to build.  \"We believe this approach is in the best interest of the \n",
    "State and the PTU (Point Thomson Unit) Owners,\" wrote Richard \n",
    "Owen, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil.  Point Thomson holds 250 million to 300 million barrels of \n",
    "liquids, both natural gas condensates and oil, according to \n",
    "state officials. It also holds 8 trillion cubic feet of \n",
    "conventional natural gas.  Some of the 46 leases in the Point Thomson unit were \n",
    "acquired as early as 1965, and more than half were acquired \n",

    "fails in appealing an earlier ruling that it has defaulted on \n",
    "terms of its leases, Bill Van Dyke, acting director of the \n",
    "state Division of Oil and Gas, said earlier this week.  Normally, state oil and gas leases expire after five to 10 \n",
    "years if there has been no commercial development, but the unit \n",
    "has been granted many extensions.  The Point Thomson leases, aggregated into an oil-field \n",
    "unit, have been the subject of nearly two dozen development \n",
    "plans. The reserves were discovered in 1977.  Last year, Mark Myers, former director of the Alaska \n",
    "Division of Oil and Gas, ruled that Exxon Mobil had defaulted \n",
    "on its Point Thomson leases. The company had reneged on an \n",
    "agreement signed with the state in 2001 to start drilling seven \n",
    "development wells by specific deadlines, Myers said.  \"Continuing this 30-year record of non-development and \n",

    "regulatory and contractual protections for the State as owner \n",
    "of the oil and gas estate,\" Myers wrote in his 2005 decision \n",
    "that launched the state's current showdown with Exxon Mobil.  Exxon Mobil has until November 3 to appeal the state's \n",
