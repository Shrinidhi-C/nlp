oil prices signal glut as virus pushes brent into contango oil prices indicated that global markets face a renewed surplus as asia 's coronavirus hits demand , with discounts on prompt supplies emerging across the brent futures curve . brent crude has moved into a full `` contango '' structure in which each monthly contract is cheaper than the next , suggesting a glut in supply . global demand estimates are being cut as the outbreak causes severe economic disruption in china , while opec is hesitating over steps to support prices . as the glut begins to accumulate , leading oil traders such as vitoil sa , royal dutch shell plc and litasco sa are seeking to hoard crude on vessels at sea . one chinese energy company has invoked a legal clause to avoid taking delivery of liquefied natural gas . `` when the oil market is in surplus -- as it is now -- the forward curve needs to be in contango in order to pay for the storage of the building surplus , '' said bjarne schieldrop , chief commodities analyst at swedish bank seb ab . it 's the first time a full contango has taken hold in a year , he said . brent crude for april settlement rose 1.3 % to $ 53.96 a barrel on the ice futures europe exchange in london as of 10:31 a.m. london time , supported by a recovery in equity markets . the u.s. benchmark , west texas intermediate , was at $ 50.20 on the new york mercantile exchange . the north sea crude market , priced using brent , suffered an `` immediate collapse '' when shipments to asia were disrupted , said olivier jakob , managing director at consultant petromatrix gmbh . with europe also receiving shipments from the u.s. , `` a surplus can quickly be created . '' the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its partners have fanned speculation over the past two weeks that they might take action to arrest the slump in prices . a committee of their technical experts recommended last week that the coalition should deepen current supply curbs by a further 600,000 barrels a day to drain the excess created by the virus . yet the latest signals from the group have deflated those hopes . azerbaijan 's energy minister said on monday that the alliance probably would n't meet before it 's scheduled march meeting . and days after promising to announce russia 's position , energy minister alexander novak would only say on tuesday that moscow is considering the proposal . russian president vladimir putin will meet rosneft pjsc chief igor sechin on tuesday and may discuss opec + issues with him , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters .
