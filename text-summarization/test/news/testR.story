ANCHORAGE, Alaska  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) offered 
to pay a $20 million fine and relinquish some leases to the 
state of Alaska to resolve a dispute over a North Slope oil and 
gas field that has remained undeveloped for decades, according 
to a letter made public on Friday. 

  In a proposal sent earlier this week to the Alaska 
Department of Natural Resources, Exxon Mobil offered to pay the 
fine and surrender about 20,000 acres of the 116,000-acre Point 
Thomson unit for failure to develop the field as quickly as 
promised.  The company's offer was accompanied by an updated plan that 
links future field development to a yet-to-be-built pipeline 
that would ship North Slope natural gas to the lower 48 U.S. 
states. The natural gas pipeline, a massive project estimated 
to cost over $20 billion, is expected to take years to build.  "We believe this approach is in the best interest of the 
State and the PTU (Point Thomson Unit) Owners," wrote Richard 
Owen, Alaska production manager for Exxon Mobil.  Point Thomson holds 250 million to 300 million barrels of 
liquids, both natural gas condensates and oil, according to 
state officials. It also holds 8 trillion cubic feet of 
conventional natural gas.  Some of the 46 leases in the Point Thomson unit were 
acquired as early as 1965, and more than half were acquired 
before 1970, according to state information.  Exxon Mobil and its partners -- BP Plc ( BP.L ), Chevron 
( CVX.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) -- risk losing nearly all 
the Point Thomson leases if the state finds the new offer 
insufficient.  The state can trigger revocation action if it deems the 
company's new development plan unacceptable and if Exxon Mobil 
fails in appealing an earlier ruling that it has defaulted on 
terms of its leases, Bill Van Dyke, acting director of the 
state Division of Oil and Gas, said earlier this week.  Normally, state oil and gas leases expire after five to 10 
years if there has been no commercial development, but the unit 
has been granted many extensions.  The Point Thomson leases, aggregated into an oil-field 
unit, have been the subject of nearly two dozen development 
plans. The reserves were discovered in 1977.  Last year, Mark Myers, former director of the Alaska 
Division of Oil and Gas, ruled that Exxon Mobil had defaulted 
on its Point Thomson leases. The company had reneged on an 
agreement signed with the state in 2001 to start drilling seven 
development wells by specific deadlines, Myers said.  "Continuing this 30-year record of non-development and 
delay of an oil and gas lessee's obligation to develop and 
produce its oil and gas lease makes a mockery of the statutory, 
regulatory and contractual protections for the State as owner 
of the oil and gas estate," Myers wrote in his 2005 decision 
that launched the state's current showdown with Exxon Mobil.  Exxon Mobil has until November 3 to appeal the state's 
default declaration, and a hearing on the appeal is scheduled 
10 days after that, state officials said.
